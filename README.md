# FalconScoutingSoftware
The Falcon Scouting System was my first big application that I created during my sophomore year of high school while on the Carl Hayden Robotics Team. This application allowed us to scout other robotics teams during competition to see how we stacked with the competition as well as discovering potential partners for the bracket portion of the competition.

Keep in mind, this was my first big application ever. The code is not written very pretty nor is it optimal. However, I feel this project was on par if not harder than most programs given in class for universities. 

This application was written in C# and what I had to learn/overcome was:
  How to get joysticks to manipulate a UI
  How to import csv file and display its contents to a UI
  Save information to a text file
  Export csv files to excel (all through the program)
  Import excel sheets to the program
  Manipulate Excel sheets via the program
  Save excel sheets

Probably the most important part of this project was that I released this to the public for any and all robotics teams to use! Here is the forum post where I shared my program, got positive feedback, and acted as a technical support for anyone trying to use my application for their own teams: https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=113210&highlight=scouting+system

At the time, I did not know how to use Github, so I posted my code to Google Code: https://code.google.com/archive/p/falcon-robotics-scouting-software/downloads
